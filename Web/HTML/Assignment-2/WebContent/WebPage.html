        <h1>Google's New Project Is So Insanely Advanced It Will Blow You Away</h1>
        <p>
           If Google has its way, our future will be nothing less than a sci-fi movie. After creeping us out with a robotic cheetah and the Google 'glass', 
		   Google is all set to bring forth something really amazing. Google's Project Soli has invented a new interaction sensor using radar technology that
		   can capture motions of your fingers at up to 10,000 frames per second. And that is something that has never ever been done before. Simply put, 
		   this technology is so bafflingly accurate that you could operate any device (fitted with this) without having to even touch it.

           Approximately the size of a small computer chip, this technology can transform your hand into a virtual dial machine to control something as
		   mundane as volume on a speaker, or into a virtual touchpad to a smartwatch or a smartphone screen. Check out the GIF below to get a better idea of how this works.

            The system uses broad beam radar to measure doppler image, IQ and spectrogram. The chip recognizes movement, velocity and distance and can be programmed to change the input based on that distance. 
			The idea is to use some of the same gestures your already using for your mobile devices and augmented those with hand motions that seem natural to interact with a Soli-enabled device. "What we propose is that you use a hand motions vocabulary," said ATAP technical program lead Ivan Poupyrev.
